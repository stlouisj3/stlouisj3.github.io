        <h1>Game Development</h1>
    <p>I have been developing games consistently since 2021, working almost entirely in Unity and as a programmer however recently I 
      have been focusing on level design. I have published seven games to Itch.io and have worked on over five
       more games published on Itch.io. I work primarily in 3D but have a lot of experience with 2D development as well. I have no type 
       of game I primarily program for as I have programmed 2D tower defense, 3D FPS puzzle, 3D Third Person Platformer, and others.
        For environmental design I have my unique style that I would classify as anything but ordinary. The thing I am most proud of 
        as a game developer is my ability to adapt to any game I am in the progress in making, and the progress I have made. Within a 
        year I went from barely knowing how to move a character to creating multiple games by myself all with different types of
         movement.I have shown off my games at multiple gaming showcases such as the MAGD Expo and The Midwest Gaming Classic.</p>

            <h1>Volunteer Work</h1>
    <p>During college I was a part of NHVP, the Nursing Home Visitation Program. Every week this program has eight visits where 
      UW-Whitewater Students go to nursing homes and play games with the residents. During my junior and senior year of college I was
       coordinator for this program where I had my own visit each week that I had to drive students to the home and back and plan out
        the activity for the week. This program has brought me so much joy, I will always remember the residents of Ridgestone of
         Delevan. I have also helped the girl scouts with other students and one of my professors, the scouts had a game development
          badge and we helped them get it by helping them create characters for a doodle jump like game. During highschool I 
          volunteered; I have helped feed the homeless and also veterans meals, also I lead a fundraiser for Mental Health America 
          by selling green ribbons and I raised $75.</p>
