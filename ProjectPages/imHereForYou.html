        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>This game was made in a 48 hour long game jam with the theme two is better than one. Three people worked on the game 
            including myself, and this was the other two peopleâ€™s first time creating a game in unity. It is a puzzle game where the 
            main mechanic is switching characters to help you get through the levels. The game has three puzzle levels, a maze, code,
             and a finding level.

         <p>This is the key code room where the player would have to switch characters to know what buttons to press and in what order.
            The code of the button changes each play through.

         <p>One of the rooms for level two where players must find the button in the room so they can switch characters and press it.</p>

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>I was the project lead for this game as I had to help my teammates learn unity. Aside from helping my teammates I did most of 
        the programming for the game, the only thing I did not program was the movement and I also built out the levels for the game.
         Along with that I created the environments for the main menu, and the last two levels.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>I learned how to lead others and help them with a project. It was a good experience as I have leadership experience 
                    but this was my first time leading a game project. This was also my first time building out levels and putting props
                     in them so I learned some shortcuts to placing props.</p>

                 <p>Final level of the game where the player must find four diamonds and use an elevator to give to the top character to place
                    on a pedestal.
