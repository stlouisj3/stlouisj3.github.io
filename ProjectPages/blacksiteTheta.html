        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>Blacksite Theta was a capstone project that I was apart of during my junior year of college. The team size was about 26 students,
            consisting of an art, programming, and marketing team. It is a third person puzzle platformer, where you must escape the labratory you are trapped in.
            Through out the game you unlock different abilities that will help you complete each level.

         <p>This is one of the levels I propped out viewed from the unity editor thus not showing any of the post processing.</p>

         <p>This is the same room with my post processing effects for prototype 2. In prototype 2 we did not do any propping out as we were waiting for assets so I focused on the lighting and post processing for the prototype.</p>

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>My role for Blacksite Theta was asset implementation, environmental artist, and general programmer. I was part of 
        the programming team, I also worked with the audio and art departments. At the beginning of the project my 
        role was to implement assets into the engine and write any scripts that are needed which at the beginning was
         a lot of interactables scripts. I implemented over 150 assets into the engine, and the scripts I wrote are the 
         death state script. Buttons script, moving platforms, and some scripts that did not make it into the game such 
         as a laser script and a keycode script. Later on in the project I was asked to handle all the lighting for the g
         ame as well as propping out levels. The levels I propped out were the starting room, level layout room, all of 
         the hookshot levels, and the first four electric rooms. With lighting I created post processing effects that helped
          create the mood for the game.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>Like any other project I have worked on, I learned a lot from working on this game. Going into the development of this game
                I had little experience with environmental design, as I am primaraly a programmer. I was apart of the programming team how ever 
                the team needed someone to start propping out the levels and working on the lighting and post processing so I volunteered. This was
                my first time working with post processing and creating environments, thus I had a lot of learning to do. I learned about how lighting 
                interacts with the scene, what different post processing settings do (vignette, fog, bloom, etc...), and how to easily add props to a unity scene.
                </p>

                 <p>This is the final product for one of the rooms I made. There was a huge change from prototype 2. I added in props, changed some things with the post processing like the fog and vignette values, as well as adding decals.</p>
