        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Double Jump Gaming News was a class I was a part of that focused on reporting gaming news through podcasts, articles, and 
            videos. The class was last run years ago and was in need of a website revamp thus a classmate and myself took up the 
            responsibility of creating the new website. This website was created from scratch instead of just using the old website 
            code, however we kept the files as we needed to preserve the articles and art from the previous class. Both of us were new
             to programming a website and we did not use bootstrap for this website which looking back at it is embarrassing however 
             it was a good learning experience. The website has pages for articles and videos that students have written during that 
             semester and prior semesters, podcasts that were recorded during the semester, games that UW- Whitewater Students have 
             made, artwork that UW-Whitewater students have made, and an about us page to show what work the students did.

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>As I said I helped create the website from the ground up, before we did any programming I was tasked with coming up with a paper 
        wireframe for the website, and all the pages formats were based on my design, except for the video and articles pages as he
         thought up that great idea for the design.After seeing his design for the videos and articles pages it helped me create an 
         idea for the podcast page as I was essentially copying his design but having the most recent podcast being shown at the top. 
         After I had the wireframe built out we started coding the website, I was responsible for creating the homepage, podcast, 
         games, artwork, and about us pages. I had many challenges with creating the website and it went through many revisions early
          on in the planning stages to make sure we had a simple layout that users could understand.

                 <p>The inspiration for this design comes from a game select menu similar to nintendos NES classics for the switch.
