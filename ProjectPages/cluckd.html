            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>I was the tech lead for this project, my main task was to keep everyone in the class on track so we can have a final project on time. Every week I would talk with other departments with what assets we needed and how those assets needed to be created. Then if anyone from the tech team had any questions they could come to me for help so we can fix the problem. The rest of the tasks I had for the project were creating the upgrade system as well as fixing bugs in time for the prototypes.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>During this project I learned how to lead a large team towards one common goal of making a fun game to play. I learned that I had to make a decision rather than just give options to my teammates. Making the decision and going with it even if it is wrong in the moment will save time in the future because we could start creating assets right away instead of playing around with features that may or may not be in the game so the art side is not going to put their resources towards that feature. </p>
