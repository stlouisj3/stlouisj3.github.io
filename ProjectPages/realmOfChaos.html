        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>Realm of Chaos is a solo project I started work on the summer before my senior year of college, the idea came from always 
            wanting to work on a first person shoot em up, and loving punk music. This game is a culmination of all things I love, from 
            fps, and punk music to fast paced games with abilities that had inspiration from anime. This game went through many changes
            throughout the development process, I initially wanted to make a level based game however with time restrictions I had to 
            switch to a round based system to focus more on the mechanics of the game.

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>This was a solo project for me, I made a first person controller along with first person shooting and abilities. The shooting is 
        dynamic where all I have to do is make a scriptable object for the gun I want to add which has all its values, info and model
        which makes it very simple to add more guns if I want to. The abilities work in a similar way as you can choose different classes
        which all have different abilities thus I need to be able to easily switch abilities and makes it so if I want to add a story model
        to the game I can easily change abilities aswell. The part I enjoyed the most about this project was making the art for the project,
        I love punk music and artstyle and with this game I was able to add in and work with both of them. The art style I took inspiration from
        was a "Sex Pistols" poster along with older punk  posters and a KennyHoopla album cover.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>I learned a lot about the design process of a game, this is the first game where I had to think about level design
                    and take into consideration how the player will move throughout the level and how enemies will interact. Then 
                I also had to take into consideration balancing as I want the player to feel powerful but also with a bunch of adrenaline,
             so I had to make sure there are a lot of enemies and that they are fast but can also be killed fast so the player is always moving
            but can also get out of situations fast. The biggest thing I learned however was player feedback, that with every action needs
        a reaction from the game. From playtests players were wondering if they were hitting an enemy or not so I needed to add more feedback 
    into the game. </p>
