        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>Solar Survivor was made for my portfolio class with two other students, it is a first person space shoot em up. You collect 
          score by destroying enemy ships, and the mother ship. We went for an 80's sci fi and anime aesthic, we got inspiration
          from Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Cowboy Bebop.

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>I was the project lead for this project, I designed the game concept and how the gameplay would work. I created scripts for enemy 
      movement and shooting, enemy spawning, and round management. I worked on the post processing of the game and cleaning up 
      a lot of the bugs and little things for the game, like adding feedback to the player when they hit a target. I did a lot of testing 
      for this game, the main focus of my test were to make sure the pace of the game was where I wanted it to be, so I had to change 
      the values for player and enemy health, how much damge the player and enemy deal, and how often enemy ships should spawn and how 
      fast they should move.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>I learned a lot about managing a game project and about the small details in games that make the player
                  feel more in control. I had to set tasks for each group member and make sure they could complete those tasks 
                in the given time and keep them acountable which I have not done before. We wanted this game to feel polished
              so I had to do a lot of testing and learned about all the little parts of games that make them feel good to play.
            A lot of it was dealing with player feedback, so when you hit a ship the hit marker changes colors, or when you take damage
          your screen starts to crack. </p>
