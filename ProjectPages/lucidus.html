        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>Lucidous was made in a 48 hour game jam using Unity, with four people including myself. It is quite different from many
             other games as we could not agree on one game so we made three different types of games and connected them through story.
              There was a beat 'em up level, three puzzle levels, and a horror level. We connected by having the story be set in a
               dream where your goal is to escape the dreams you are in. 

        </p>

         <img src="../ProjectPictures/lucidusPic2.png" style=" width: 100%;">
         <p>The game is based about you escaping your dream thus I wanted to create a very weird and wacky environment that fits a dream</p>

         <img src="../ProjectPictures/lucidusPic3.png" style="width: 100%;">
         <p>The inspiration for the colors and environment was Alice in Wonderland where that was a very weird environment where you 
            believe anything could be there.

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>I worked on the puzzle levels and the post processing for the game. I designed each puzzle level, created the environments, and 
        did slight programming for it, the biggest contribution would be the pet that follows you around in the levels. This gave me 
        another chance to practice my environmental design, audio production, and creativity. I also recorded dialogue for the game 
        which can be heard in the puzzle levels.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>This project was really about practicing the skills I already have such as post processing and environmental design. 
                    However I did learn about production for video games as this was my first time recording dialogue for a game. It
                     was good to learn how to record sound and keep it consistent and also how to manipulate the audio files. I used 
                     audacity to record and edit the audio clips and it was my second time ever using the software. </p>

                 <p>This is the final puzzle level that I created for the game, each level had the same feel however very few props are shared
                    between the levels as I wanted each level to feel slightly different as dreams seems to change a lot.
