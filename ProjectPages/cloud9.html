        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <p>This was a final project for a 3d unity class I took my sophomore year. We had a little over a month and a half to make the 
            game. We had three team members including myself, and all of us were new to 3d unity development and it was our first 3d 
            game. The game is a space themed 3d platformer and only contains one level as that is all we had time to develop.

         <p>The game is set in space where you need to escape the spaceship and return back home to earth.</p>

            <h1>What I Worked On</h1>
    <p>I worked on everything dealing with character for this game except for actually modeling the character. I created the movement 
        script, his shooting ability, the camera movement was cinemachine however I created a script to shake the camera occasionally
         and play a sound. I also got animations from Mixamo and created events in my scripts to add animations for the character. I 
         also created health scripts for the player and an enemy that shoots the player within a certain distance. This project was 
         quite challenging for me as I never made a game in 3d prior to these and faced a lot of challenges getting the camera to feel 
         good and work with a controller. Also learning Unities animator was quite challenging and I had to do a lot of research when 
         creating scripts for this game.

                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                <p>I learned a lot from making this game, as stated this was my first 3d unity project thus I had a lot to learn to 
                    make a working project. I learned some of the packages unity offers such as the new input system, and cinemachine 
                    and how to use those. I learned the basics of character movement and some of the different ways to move the player 
                    either through a character controller or through physics and a rigidbody. The most fun thing I learned in this
                     project was how to create a shooting script and the basics of a raycast and how to use it. I did use colliders
                      for hit detection which caused some problems and now I understand I should have just used raycast but I was only
                       first introduced to raycast so I just used it to tell the bullet where to go. As well as the shooting script I 
                       learned how to create an enemy who only shoots at the player when they are close enough to the enemy. The most 
                       challenging thing that I learned was the basics of the animator and animator events. I had no experience with 
                       the animator prior and spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the player to have animations and
                        to match up footsteps with the animation. Overall I was very overwhelmed with the amount of information I had 
                        to learn to make this project but it was worth it as I learned a lot from it and gave me a lot of confidence 
                        in developing games.</p>

                 <p>The game had many challenges during development, including file sharing as we had issues with github and almost
                    lost all progress and had to share the file through google drive during the last week of development.
